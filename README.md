# OpenSesame
The purpose of OpenSesame allows users to safely share passwords by inviting other users to their accounts. 
The program will autofill and export CSV files, and it will generate strong, unique passwords for the users. 
Its intended audience is families and close friends to share passwords with each other without the need of sending constantly updated information.
Due to the short timeframe, information will be stored locally. Ideally, it would be exported to a server.


To Run OpenSesame:
1. Download the Project and Upload it to an IDE
2. Ensure you have a JDK Installed on your PC
3. Compile and run the main method.
